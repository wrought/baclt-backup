Brown Shingle includes three large brown shingle houses on a single property in South Berkeley. The houses were built in 1913, with a mix of four large 3 bedroom flats, a large communal house, and the original water tower.&nbsp; The property had been self-managed since 1975, when the tenants forced the landlord into foreclosure after a two-year rent strike and were able to purchase the property.&nbsp; The landlord intended to tear down the houses and replace them with a large apartment building. The tenants were part of Berkeley Tenants Union, Local 7, and were part of a much larger rent strike involving many properties in Berkeley from 1973 to 1975. In 2002, the tenants put the houses into a Limited Liability Corporation or LLC, as a legal ownership structure.&nbsp; <br></span></p>

BACLT will manage the property as rental housing for an interim period, while providing the residents with technical assistance and training so they can manage the property effectively. Our goal is to return the property to partial resident management, with ongoing oversight and technical assistance from the land trust.
